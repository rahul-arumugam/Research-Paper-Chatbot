      "In this paper, the authors explore a technique to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Doc2Query by filtering out queries that do not reflect the original passage. This approach, called Doc2Query-- (Doc2Query-minus-minus), uses existing neural relevance models to identify and remove poor queries prior to indexing. Through experimentation on the MS MARCO dataset, the authors find that their filtering approach can improve the retrieval effectiveness of indexes built using Doc2Query-- by up to 16%. Additionally, filtering naturally reduces the index size, lowering storage and query-time computational costs. Finally, the authors explore the index-time overheads introduced by the filtering process and conclude that the gains from filtering more than make up for the additional time spent generating more queries. The approach also has a positive impact on the environmental costs of applying Doc2Query; the same retrieval effectiveness can be achieved with only about a third of the computational cost when indexing.\n",
